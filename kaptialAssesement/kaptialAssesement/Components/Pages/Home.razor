<h2>Project Title: Customer Management System</h2>

<b>Objective:</b> Develop a web application using ASP.NET Core, C#, and Blazor WebAssembly
that allows for the management of customer information and categorization. The
application should implement the Repository Design Pattern and utilize a SQL Server
database for data persistence.
<br />
<br />
<h5>Entities</h5>
<b>Customer</b>
<br />
• CustomerID (Primary Key, auto-generated)
<br />
• Name
<br />
• Email
<br />
• PhoneNumber
<br />
• CategoryID (Foreign Key to CustomerCategory)
<br />
<br />
<b>CustomerCategory</b>
<br />
• CategoryID (Primary Key, auto-generated)
<br />
• CategoryName
<br />
<br />
<b>Functionality:</b> Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both
entities within the application. This includes: 
<br />
o Adding new customers and categories.
<br />
o Viewing a list of all customers and categories.
<br />
o Updating existing customer and category details.
<br />
o Deleting customers and categories.
<br />
<br />
<b>Repository Design Pattern:</b> Use the Repository Design Pattern to abstract the data
layer, providing a separation between the application's business logic and the data
access logic.
<br />
<br />
<b>User Interface:</b>Develop a user-friendly web interface using Blazor WebAssembly
that interacts with the backend services to perform CRUD operations.
<br />
<br />
<b>Database Design:</b> Design and implement a SQL Server database schema that
supports the entities and their relationships. Include SQL scripts for creating the
database, tables, and seeding initial data.
<br />
<br />
<b>Validation:</b> Implement validation for the input forms to ensure data integrity (e.g.,
required fields, email format).
